# `mlp/src/events.py`
## Overview:
This Python script provides a utility function, `modify_function`, which programmatically alters the behavior of a given function. It uses the ast module (Abstract Syntax Trees) and the inspect module to transform the function's source code, making it return a predefined string regardless of its original implementation.

### `modify_function` (function):
**Description:** alters the implementation of a passed-in function such that, regardless of its original code, it now returns a specific string: "Modified return value". This function demonstrates a technique for code manipulation using Python's abstract syntax trees, which could be applied in more complex scenarios like code analysis, optimization, or transformation.

**Parameters:**
- `func`: the function to be modified. It is expected to be a callable object whose source can be inspected.

**Process:**
- **Source extraction:** uses `inspect.getsource(func)` to obtain the source code of the passed-in function.
- **AST parsing:** converts the source code into an abstract syntax tree using `ast.parse(src)`, allowing for programmatic inspection and modification of the code structure.
- **AST modification:** traverses the AST using `ast.walk(parsed)`, looking for a `FunctionDef` node (the definition of the function). Once found, it modifies this node by replacing its body with a new return statement, ensuring the function will return the string "Modified return value".
- **AST Compilation:** the modified AST is compiled back into executable Python code using the compile function.
- **Namespace execution:** executes the compiled code within a new local namespace (`local_namespace` dictionary) to avoid polluting the global namespace.
- **Function replacement:** the original function is replaced with the modified version by returning the new function from the `local_namespace` dictionary, keyed by the original functionâ€™s name.
- **Returns:** a new function with the same name as func but modified such that its body consists solely of a return statement with the fixed value "Modified return value".
