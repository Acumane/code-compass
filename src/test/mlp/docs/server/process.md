# `mlp/src/process.py`
## Overview:
This Python code defines a function named segment that performs semantic segmentation on an input image frame using a pre-trained DeepLabV3 model. Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves labeling each pixel of an image with a class representing what is being depicted.


### `segment` (function):
**Parameters:**
- `frame`: a numpy array representing the image frame to be segmented. This array is typically of shape `(H, W, 3)` where `H` and `W` are the height and width of the image, respectively.

**Returns:** a 2D numpy array representing the segmented image. Each pixel in this array corresponds to a class label identified by the semantic segmentation model.

**Behavior:**
- **Model loading:** the function loads a pre-trained DeepLabV3 model with a ResNet-101 backbone. This model has been trained on a standard dataset (likely COCO or a similar large-scale dataset) for the task of semantic segmentation.
- **Image processing:** the input frame, originally a numpy array, is converted to a PIL image. This image is then converted to a tensor and normalized using the standard mean and standard deviation values for the dataset on which the model was trained.
- **Segmentation:** the function adds an extra batch dimension to the tensor and then feeds it to the pre-trained model. The segmentation is performed in a no-gradient context (`torch.no_grad()`), meaning that gradients are not computed, which saves memory and computational resources during inference.
- **Output processing:** the output from the model is a tensor where each pixel's value corresponds to the predicted class for that pixel. The function converts this tensor to a 2D numpy array, where each element represents the class label for the corresponding pixel in the original image.
