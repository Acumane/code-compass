# `tests/test_basic.py`

## File Overview:

This file contains a simple unit test function designed for a Python testing framework, such as `pytest` or `unittest`. The purpose of this file and its contained function should ideally be part of a larger testing strategy, aimed at ensuring the reliability and correctness of a codebase.

## Function Description:

1. `**test_basic**`
    - **Purpose**: This function serves as a foundational or placeholder test within the test suite. Its primary role is to ensure that the testing environment is correctly set up and that the most fundamental assertion passes.
    - **Behavior**: The function contains a single assertion statement, assert True, which is a basic assertion that always passes. This kind of assertion is often used as a sanity check.
